## Minimalist Elegance: The Rise of Subtle Nail Art

### Ice Cream Manicure

The "ice cream manicure" is a refined take on the classic French tip. Featuring a creamy white polish that seamlessly blends with a sheer nude or soft pink base, it creates a melty, whipped-gelato effect. This minimalist design aligns with the "quiet luxury" movement, offering an understated yet polished look suitable for all nail shapes and lengths. ([InStyle][1])

### Sheer Pink Nails

Sheer pink manicures have made a significant comeback, epitomized by Halle Berry's elegant look at the 2025 Met Gala. Using soft, creamy pink tones on neatly rounded nails, this style blends sophistication and versatility, making it ideal for both formal events and everyday wear. ([Woman & Home][2])

## Bold and Playful: Embracing Vibrant Designs

### Jelly Textures

Jelly nails, characterized by their squishy, translucent finish, are perfect for summer. Best suited for short nails, they offer a fun and youthful vibe. Tone-on-tone French manicures using matching jelly and cream polishes are also gaining popularity, adding a textured look to the classic French tip. ([Byrdie][3])

### 3D Embellishments

Three-dimensional nail art is taking center stage, with designs featuring tiny flowers, seashells, and other playful charms. These embellishments add depth and texture, transforming nails into miniature works of art. Nail artist Rachel Sun, known for her work with Grammy winner Doechii, predicts that asymmetrical and "cube" nails will dominate 2025. ([Byrdie][3], [Popsugar][4])
